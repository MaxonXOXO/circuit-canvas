## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **React-based web application** for building simple circuits visually. (May use Vite or Tailwind CSS in future)  
Users can drag electronic components from a sidebar, drop them on a canvas, and arrange them using an invisible grid with snapping support.  

Here’s a draft `README.md` tailored for **Infinite Circuits** and CyberLife Labs. It presents your project professionally, sets a roadmap, and positions it as your startup’s first release:
